# Links

1. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-operating-system/)<br>
The link above essentially gives a complete explanation on what an operating system is.
I find the link to be very helpful as a gateway in understanding what the course is about.

2. (https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)<br>
This link is pretty simple however, considering that majority of this course makes use of markdown files, the link is a very helpful cheatsheet on the different markdown syntaxes. With this link, I would have a much easier time in editing and completing a markdown file, making sure that its contents are legible as well as neat.

3. (https://vim.rtorr.com/)<br>
The link above is quite simple a vim cheatsheet. I find the link to be really helpful, especially since I am very new to vim as it helps me work my way through the text editor and guide me on how to properly use it. With that said, it helps me avoid mistakes which could end up possibly breaking scripts that I wrote with it.
