# Links

1. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-operating-system/)<br>
The link above essentially gives a complete explanation on what an operating system is.
I find the link to be very helpful as a gateway in understanding what the course is about.

2. (https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)<br>
This link is pretty simple however, considering that majority of this course makes use of markdown files, the link is a very helpful cheatsheet on the different markdown formats. With this link, I would have a much easier time in editing and creating a markdown file complete, making sure that its contents are legible as well as neat.
